# Chatbot Flow Builder

## Overview
This project is a simple chatbot flow builder implemented in React, utilizing the React Flow library. It allows users to create chatbot flows by connecting text nodes together. The builder supports various features including a nodes panel, edges, handles, a settings panel, and a save button.

## Features
1. **Text Node**: Allows users to add text messages to the flow.
2. **Nodes Panel**: Displays available node types for adding to the flow. Easily extensible for future node types.
3. **Edge**: Connects nodes together to define the flow.
4. **Source Handle**: Origin of a connecting edge.
5. **Target Handle**: Destination of a connecting edge. Supports multiple connections.
6. **Settings Panel**: Replaces the nodes panel when a node is selected, enabling users to edit text content.
7. **Save Button**: Saves the flow. Displays an error if multiple nodes have empty target handles.
